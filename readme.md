# Multi User Dungeon - Admin Dashboard

A project to learn React by building an Admin Dashboard for <a href="https://github.com/LiamKenneth/ArchaicQuest">ArchaicQuest.</a> This can also be used for any other MUD that would want an online dashboard to manage and track the performance of their game.

## Some things I want the dashboard to show:

* Count of new players by month, week and day. Comparing the difference with the previous value.
* Average, shortest and longest play time
* List of logged errors
* List of most and least used skills and spells
* Stats on most picked race, class, gender
* Stats on most completed and most unfinished quests
* Most popular areas and mobs killed
* List of users that can be edited
* Show who's playing now
* Controls to reload the world 
* Show log of channel chats and allow Admin to respond to in game messages
* Allow Admin to view a player and see what they are doing
